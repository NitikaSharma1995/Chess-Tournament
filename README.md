# Chess-Tournament
Description of the Project: This is the Chess Database Project that I created in my Database foundations class. 

**ZUMA International Chess Organization**
My organization has sub branch in many countries and its HQ is in Dallas. The club always accepts new players and their chess clubs. At the beginning of the every May, I am starting a new tournament and all clubs must have a participant to attend. After the tournament is done, rankings will be posted on your club web site.
